    UpSnap provides an intuitive dashboard to wake devices with one click, schedule timed events, and scan networks for devices.
    Built with SvelteKit, Go, and PocketBase, it supports secure user management, multi-language support, and customizable themes.
    Ideal for self-hosting with Docker or binary options, it integrates features like port pinging and network discovery.
    While offering powerful functionality, it's recommended to use VPN for external access due to security.
