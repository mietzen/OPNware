    a lightweight and portable command-line YAML processor. yq uses jq like syntax but works with yaml files as well as json.
    It doesn't yet support everything jq does - but it does support the most common operations and functions, and more is being added continuously.
    yq is written in go - so you can download a dependency free binary for your platform and you are good to go!
    If you prefer there are a variety of package managers that can be used as well as docker, all listed below.
