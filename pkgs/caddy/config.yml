    Caddy is a platform for running Go applications and serves as a highly extensible HTTPS server.
    Applications are implemented as Caddy modules, with tls and http included by default.
    It supports automated documentation, live configuration updates via API, and seamless integration with other modules.
    Configuration is primarily managed through its JSON-based API, but adapters allow the use of formats like Caddyfile, YAML, and NGINX config.
    Caddy consolidates all settings into a single configuration document, simplifying management and reducing complexity.
    Its design enables precise control over in-memory components, such as HTTP handlers and TLS.
    The plugin system allows extensive customization and improvements beyond other web servers.
    Refer to the documentation for details on configuration structure.
