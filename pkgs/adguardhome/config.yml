    AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking.
    After you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any client-side software for that.
    It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a "black hole," thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers.
    It's based on software we use for our public AdGuard DNS servers -- both share a lot of common code.
    IMPORTANT:
    - Once it's installed, open http://127.0.0.1:3000/ in your browser to do the initial setup and learn how to configure your devices to use AdGuard Home.
      You don't need to Launch anything explicitly, AdGuard Home service is already started after the installation.
    - If you're running it on Ubuntu, you may need to select a different "Listen interface" for the DNS server.
      Listening to all interfaces is not possible because Ubuntu's systemd-resolved service uses 127.0.0.1:53 already.
