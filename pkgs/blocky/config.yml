    Blocky is a Go-based DNS proxy and ad-blocker for local networks.
    It blocks ads, malware, and unwanted domains with customizable allow/deny lists, regex filtering, and deep CNAME inspection.
    It supports custom DNS resolution, conditional forwarding, and per-client upstream resolvers.
    Performance features include caching, prefetching, and parallel resolvers. Supports DoH, DoT, and DNSSEC for security.
    Provides Prometheus metrics, REST API, and database logging.
    Open-source with no telemetry.
