    Zsh is the Swiss Army knife of shells. It combines the most popular
    features of every other shell, and then lets you customize every
    inch of it. Users of bourne-style and C-style shells will feel at
    home in it.

    Zsh does intelligent completion, spell-checking, has a rich syntax
    for precise globbing, and is fully extensible through plugin
    systems.

    This variant comes with statically linked zsh modules like zsh/regex to ease the consumption of existing scripts relying on such modules.
